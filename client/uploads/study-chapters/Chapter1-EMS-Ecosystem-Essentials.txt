## Introduction to Emergency Medical Services

Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems provide emergency medical care and transport. The system includes:

### Key Components:
- **First Responders**: Police, fire department personnel
- **Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs)**: Basic life support providers
- **Paramedics**: Advanced life support providers
- **Emergency Departments**: Hospital-based care

### EMT-B Scope of Practice:
- Patient assessment using AVPU scale
- Basic airway management
- Oxygen administration
- CPR and AED operation
- Basic trauma care
- Medication assistance (limited scope)

### AVPU Scale:
- **Alert**: Patient is awake and aware
- **Verbal**: Patient responds to verbal stimuli
- **Pain**: Patient responds only to painful stimuli
- **Unresponsive**: No response to any stimuli

### Vital Signs Assessment:
- Respiratory rate: 12-20 breaths per minute (adult)
- Pulse rate: 60-100 beats per minute (adult)
- Blood pressure: Normal systolic 90-140 mmHg
- Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C) normal

The EMS system operates on the principle of rapid assessment, stabilization, and transport to appropriate medical facilities.
