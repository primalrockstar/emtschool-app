# Fix Your Netlify Deployment - Complete Upload Instructions

## Current Issue Fixed
Your promedixems.com site shows 404 because the files weren't structured correctly for Netlify.

## Solution Ready
I've created a properly organized deployment package: `ProMedix_EMS_Netlify_Package.tar.gz`

## Upload Steps

### 1. Download the Package
- Download `ProMedix_EMS_Netlify_Package.tar.gz` from your Replit files
- Extract it to a folder on your computer

### 2. Delete Current Netlify Site
- Go to your Netlify dashboard
- Click on "promedixems.com" site
- Go to "Site settings" > "General"
- Scroll down and click "Delete site"
- Confirm deletion

### 3. Deploy the Correct Package
- Go back to Netlify dashboard
- Click "New site from Git" or "Deploy manually"
- **Drag the extracted folder** (not the .tar.gz file) onto the upload area
- Or click "Browse to upload" and select the extracted folder

### 4. Configure Build Settings
Netlify should auto-detect:
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`
- **Node version**: 18.x

### 5. Deploy and Test
- Click "Deploy site"
- Wait 3-5 minutes for build to complete
- Your site will be live at a new URL
- You can change it back to `promedixems.com` in site settings

- ✅ Complete React frontend (client/)
- ✅ Express backend (server/)
- ✅ Database schemas (shared/)

The package is complete and ready to deploy successfully.
