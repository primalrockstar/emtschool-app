# Deploy ProMedix EMS to Netlify - Alternative to Vercel

## Why Netlify Instead of Vercel
- Simple drag-and-drop deployment
- No GitHub connection required
- Free tier with reliable hosting
- Works perfectly with React + Express apps

## Step-by-Step Netlify Deployment

### 1. Go to Netlify
- Visit **netlify.com**
- Click **"Get started for free"** or **"Log in"**
- Create account (or use GitHub/Google)

### 2. Deploy Your Site
- Look for **"Deploy manually"** or **"Drag and drop"**
- Find the large deployment area
- **Drag your `promedix-ems` folder** directly onto the page
- Netlify will upload and build automatically

### 3. Alternative Upload Method
If drag-and-drop isn't visible:
- Click **"New site from Git"**
- Look for **"Deploy manually"** option
- Browse and select your `promedix-ems` folder

### 4. Build Settings (Auto-detected)
Netlify should automatically detect:
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`
- **Node.js version**: 18.x

### 5. Deploy and Get URL
- Deployment takes 2-3 minutes
- You get a live URL: `random-name.netlify.app`
- Can customize to: `promedix-ems.netlify.app`

## Why This Solves Your Problem
- **No more restarts** - 99.9% uptime
- **Professional hosting** - Enterprise infrastructure
- **Free tier** - No additional cost
- **Same platform** - All features preserved

## Backup Options
If Netlify also has issues:
- **Railway.app** - Great for full-stack apps
- **Render.com** - Free hosting tier
- **Surge.sh** - Simple static deployment

Your organized files work with any of these platforms.
