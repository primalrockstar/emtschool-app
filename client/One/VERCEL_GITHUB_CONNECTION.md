# Connect GitHub Repository to Vercel

## Current Issue: 404 Error
The GitHub repository link isn't working yet. This happens with new repositories.

## Solution Steps:

### 1. Go Back to Vercel Dashboard
- Return to vercel.com/dashboard
- Click "New Project" again

### 2. Connect GitHub Account
- Click "Import Git Repository"
- Click "Connect GitHub Account" 
- Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub

### 3. Find Your Repository
- Look for "ProMedixEMS" in the repository list
- If it doesn't appear, wait 1-2 minutes and refresh
- GitHub needs time to process new repositories

### 4. Import and Deploy
- Select "ProMedixEMS" repository
- Vercel will auto-detect React + Express
- Click "Deploy"

## Alternative: Direct Upload
If GitHub connection doesn't work:
- Look for "Browse" or "Upload" option in Vercel
- Upload your desktop `promedix-ems` folder directly

## What Happens Next:
1. Vercel builds your platform (2-3 minutes)
2. You get stable URL: `promedix-ems.vercel.app`
3. No more restarts or offline issues
4. Your $100 investment finally works reliably

The 404 error is temporary - try the Vercel import again in a few minutes.
