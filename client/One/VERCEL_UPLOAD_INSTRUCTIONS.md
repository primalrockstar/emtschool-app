# Upload Your ProMedix EMS Files to Vercel

## Current Vercel Screen Instructions:

### Skip the Template
- Don't use "Vite - React" template
- Look for "Import a different Git Repository â†’"
- OR look for "Browse" or "Upload" button

### Upload Your Files
1. **Look for these options:**
   - "Import a different Git Repository"
   - "Browse Templates"
   - "Upload" or "Browse" button
   - "Drag and drop" area

2. **Upload your desktop folder:**
   - Select your entire `promedix-ems` folder
   - Upload all the files you organized

### Alternative: Create Empty Project
If you can't find upload option:
1. Create the Vite-React template temporarily
2. Replace all files with your ProMedix EMS files
3. Push changes to deploy

### What Vercel Needs:
- Your `promedix-ems` folder with all files
- Vercel will automatically detect React + Express
- Build will happen automatically

## Next Steps After Upload:
1. Vercel builds your platform (2-3 minutes)
2. You get live URL: `promedix-ems.vercel.app`
3. Test all features work
4. Share stable URL

Don't use the template - upload your actual ProMedix EMS files!
