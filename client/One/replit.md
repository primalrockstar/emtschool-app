# ProMedix EMS Training Platform

## Overview

ProMedix EMS is a comprehensive Emergency Medical Services (EMS) training and reference platform built as a full-stack web application. The system provides EMT, AEMT, and Paramedic professionals with protocols, medication references, simulations, and assessments to support their training and field work.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Hosting**: Designed for deployment on Replit with autoscale capabilities
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components for consistent design

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Router**: Using Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Component Library**: Comprehensive shadcn/ui component system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom medical-themed color palette

2. **Medication Reference**: Comprehensive drug database with pediatric dosing
3. **Interactive Simulations**: Scenario-based training with difficulty levels
4. **Assessment System**: Checklist-based evaluations with scoring
5. **Progress Tracking**: User advancement monitoring across categories
6. **Mobile Support**: Optimized for field use on mobile devices

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components make API calls through TanStack Query
2. **API Processing**: Express routes handle requests and validate data using Zod schemas
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM executes type-safe database queries
4. **Response Formatting**: Structured JSON responses with error handling
5. **State Updates**: Client state automatically updates through query invalidation

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across frontend and backend
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and TypeScript compiler checks
- **Development**: Hot reload and error overlay for development experience

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for Replit deployment with:

- **Development Mode**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend in development
- **Production Build**: `npm run build` creates optimized production bundles
- **Database Setup**: `npm run db:push` applies schema changes to PostgreSQL
- **Port Configuration**: Server runs on port 5000 with external port 80
- **Environment**: PostgreSQL 16 module with Node.js 20 runtime

The build process:
1. Frontend builds to `dist/public` using Vite
2. Backend bundles to `dist/index.js` using esbuild
3. Static files served from the Express server in production
4. Database migrations applied through Drizzle Kit

## Medical Content Standards
All medical protocols, medications, treatments, and assessments on this platform are based on Clark County EMS protocols to ensure regional accuracy and compliance for Las Vegas area EMT training. Educational disclaimers are prominently displayed to clarify the training-only nature of the content.

## Professional Deployment Status
The platform has been shared with active paramedics and EMS professionals for real-world field testing and training use. All medical content is validated against Clark County protocols for regional accuracy.
