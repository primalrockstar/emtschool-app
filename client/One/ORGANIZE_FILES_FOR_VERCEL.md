# Organize Files for Netlify Deployment

## Current Issue
The deployment shows as successful but gives 404 errors, meaning the files aren't structured correctly for Netlify.

## Required File Structure for Netlify
Netlify needs either:
1. A built static site (HTML/CSS/JS files)
2. A properly configured full-stack app

## Solution: Create Deployment Package

### Option 1: Build Static Version (Recommended)
1. Run `npm run build` on your local files
2. Upload the `dist` folder to Netlify
3. This creates a static version that works instantly

### Option 2: Configure Full-Stack App
1. Add `netlify.toml` configuration file
2. Set build commands and publish directory
3. Configure serverless functions for backend

## Quick Fix for Current Deployment
Go to your Netlify dashboard:
1. Click on your "promedixems.com" site
2. Go to "Site settings" > "Build & deploy"
3. Change "Publish directory" from root to `dist`
4. Trigger a new deploy

## Files to Upload
Make sure your upload includes:
- `package.json` (with build scripts)
- `client/` folder (React app)
- `server/` folder (Express backend)
- `shared/` folder (shared schemas)
- `vite.config.ts` (build configuration)

The 404 error is fixable - we just need to structure the files correctly for Netlify's deployment system.
